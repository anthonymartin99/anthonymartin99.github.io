<h3>Welcome to my website! Here you will find everything you need to know about my education so far!</h3> 
<main>
    <p>Hello! I am Anthony Martin and I live in Chesterfield, Missouri. I am attending Mizzou to earn my bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering. I am also a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity at Mizzou. The only prior experience I have in web development is from taking a basic web design class in high school. I took Introduction to Web Development with the hopes of learning how to create a working and unique website.  I am hoping this class goes more in depth about making a more personalized website than I was previously taught. My overall expectations for this class are that the assignments will be relatively understandable and user friendly. I hope to one day create a website for a business with my learned web development skills. My favorite hobby is making and editing videos for myself and others. In the little free time that I have, I enjoy spending time with my family.</p>
