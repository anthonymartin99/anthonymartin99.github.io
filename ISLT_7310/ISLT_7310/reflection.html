<h3>Welcome to my reflection page! Here is what I have learned in my degree program.</h3>
<main>
    <p id="reflection">My experience in my degree program has been a vast majority of ups and downs. Some of the classes that I have taken have been hard while some have been more easily understood. MY hardest class so far was calculus 2. One of my favorite classes I have taken was an intro to the Solid Works application and software. It opened my eyes to a new level of design I had never known before. I intend to use this software in a lot of my future career. These classes I have taken are helping to prepare me to face failure and success in the real world. I know that I will not always succeed in a certain area but that does not mean I can try and do my best in it. Overall, I plan to use the skills I aquire through my degree program to hoepfully one day work for a defense contractor.</p>
